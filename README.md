# Extract given archive to images (`Firmware_extractor`)
This repository is used mainly by `dumpyara` in order to pull all images from an archive and easily extract them to directories.

Main objective of this project is so transform files from different manufacturers to simple EXT2 (or similar) images, in order to extract them via `7z` or any other unarchiving program.

## Set-up
As previously mentioned, this is supposed to be ran in-line with `dumpyara`. The needed packages are already installed by the `setup.sh` script [here](https://github.com/AndroidDumps/dumpyara/blob/master/setup.sh), but you might aswell run thse commands individually and execute the script standalone;
```
$ sudo apt install unace unrar zip unzip p7zip-full p7zip-rar sharutils rar uudeview mpack arj cabextract rename liblzma-dev python-pip brotli lz4 protobuf-compiler git gawk
$ pip install backports.lzma protobuf pycrypto twrpdtgen extract-dtb pycryptodome
```

## How to use
### Download
Download, through `git`, the repository to your directory of choice.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AndroidDumps/Firmware_extractor.git
```

$ wget https://dl.google.com/dl/android/aosp/walleye-pq3a.190705.001-factory-cc471c8c.zip -o firmware.zip
$ ./extractor.sh firmware.zip walleye/
```
